## Projects

Fyfrom was created to optimize the quote submission process for insurance agencies. There is still a lot of manual work in the insurance industry.  Being tired of manual work and having to work on a desktop/laptop to get a policy submitted was inefficient.  I am no longer bound to my laptop or desktop to submit a quote for my client.  

Fyform is a SaaS insurance quote submission tool that doubles as a client/policy management system.  Itâ€™s unique because it connects the client, agent and insurance carrier all in one mobile friendly platform.  Fyform helps standardize information by utilizing pre-populated information as the user proceeds with the application.  A common issue with insurance agency is finding old documents, with our file system being linked to their applications, the agent will always have access to policy information and be able to maintain the correct files which will save them headaches when an Error and Ommission problem occurs.  This platform is a first of its kind allowing the agent to process insurance application, document signature, and payment. Fyform helps eliminate application errors, missing documents, signature and payments. Allowing the agent to focus on building new client relationships and sell insurance!

Technology

Ruby on Rails was chosen as the framework for ability to scaffold/build models and ease of integration with Postgresql.  The out of the box functions such as ActiveStorage sped up development.  Rails libraries? such as devise, apartment, sidekiq, and pundit meets all business requirements.  FDFmerge was utilized to help fill out pdf forms and works well with Rails.  Being this as my first project, it was recommended to start with Rails.
